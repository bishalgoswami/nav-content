# How to: Prioritize Vendors
[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] can suggest various payments to vendors, for example, payments that will be due soon or payments where a discount is available. For more information, see [How to: Suggest Vendor Payments](payables-how-suggest-vendor-payments.md).

First, you must prioritize your vendors by assigning numbers to them.

## To prioritize vendors
1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Vendors**, and then choose the related link.
2. Select the relevant vendor, and then choose **Edit**.
3. In the **Priority** field, enter a number.

[!INCLUDE[d365fin](includes/d365fin_md.md)] considers the lowest number, except 0, to have the highest priority. So, for example, if you use 1, 2, and 3, then 1 will have the highest priority.

If you do not want to prioritize a vendor, leave the **Priority** field blank. Then, if you use the payment suggestion feature, the vendor will be listed after all the vendors that have a priority number. You can enter as many priority levels as necessary.
